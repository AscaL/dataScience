Loading Libs
```{r}
install.packages("ggthemes", dependencies = T)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```


Loading the data
```{r}
test <- read.csv("~/dataScience/final/test.csv")
train <- read.csv("~/dataScience/final/train.csv")
sampleSub <- read.csv("~/dataScience/final/sample_submission.csv")
summary(train)
head(train)
```

First plot: SquareFeet vs Sale Price
```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(y = SalePrice, x = GrLivArea)) + geom_point()
ggplot(train, aes(GrLivArea)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = 'light green', color = 'black') +
  theme_dark()
```

We can see that there are four outliers, let's remove them:
```{r}
train <- train[-which(train$GrLivArea > 4000)]
# Why am i doing this?
ggplot(train, aes(TotalBsmtSF)) + #total sqr feet of the basement
  geom_histogram(fill = 'light green', color = 'black') +
  theme_dark()
```
